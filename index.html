    <p> "The government is keeping things in secret that should be known.Things that are dangerous things that no one has ever told you before and you would not believe your ears if i told you all the things i have witnessed and
      heard" </p>

    <p>"When i first i introduced myself no one suspected me but it was like they sort of felt like i didn't belong there
      for some reason, they gave me weird stares every once in a while at every conference"</p>

    <p>There was this one time i almost blew my cover,i actually identified under the alias Celine rouge and this one
      time i was at area 51 they asked for my id,i had one but it had my real name on it almost blew my cover but one of
      the diplomats was very impatient and demanded the major to let us in so..im glad he chipped in. Or else I wouldn't
      have gotten this far with my inquisition.

    <h4 style="color:white;">Potential monarchy in The U.S</h4>
    <div class="body-text">
      <!-- body content -->
      <div id="news">
        <p>It's been reported That a monarchy is soon to arrive in the states.And Conspiracy theorist Annaelle Letono has predicted this unimaginable conception after attending several political occasions like conferences and parliaments world round.She's had secretive association with the un for months now along with other u.s organizations such as nato,congress and more.And shockingly <em>she's also been to area fifty one
            and the pentagon.</em>And yes,she has seen the aliens!,and there very real but aside from that Annaelle has
          been taking notes and making keen observations at every one of these places.And has been eavesdropping on
          shady Agenda's conspired by the government and the illuminati.She has gathered a plethora of information to
          spill and wants us be aware of the things that are discussed behind closed doors in the government.

        <p>Allegedly she's predicted they are planning to impose a monarchy and think our democratic government is not
          strong enough anymore.After having a personal interview with her she shared a few of her documentations with
          us one of which involved the president joe biden having a dialogue with other officials of the parliament.
          <strong>"To the public the Queen/king is more visible in her/his wider role as head of the nation. In this
            representative role the Sovereign acts as a focus for national identity, unity and pride; gives a sense of
            stability and continuity; officially recognizes success and excellence; and supports the ideal of voluntary
            service. The Queen/king fulfils this role through speeches such as her address to the nation at the start of
            the Covid pandemic, and annual broadcast on Christmas day; through giving honours to recognize public and
            voluntary service; and through visits to the armed forces, schools, hospitals, charities and local
            organizations".</strong>Though the president didn't exactly declare an inauguration for a monarchy it sounds
          like he is reasoning the need for a monarchy.</p>

        <p>Annaelle has also written down even more important details that she had gotten from that conference.The
        wrote down some things that were said by one of the congressmen <strong>"The Queen/king is also head of state of
          14 other countries around the world,a monarchy could help us gain more territories world-wide which could help
          improve our economic system".She also claims another congressmen said "A figurehead represents the people:
          politicians represent only their party, not the entire nation. As such, a Monarch can steer them through the
          hardest of times â€“ take George VI and Queen Elizabeth during WWII. Their presence enabled Londoners to deal
          with the Blitz, and with Buckingham Palace taking hits, they understood how the locals felt."</strong>.Though
        there's more to this than we know these details are enough to convince some of us that their may be a potential
        monarchy which may take over sooner or later.Annaelle has even given us her own perspective on this in our
        recent interviews with us in which she herself explainins how she got access to all this information without
        getting caught or suspected.If you would like to read the exclusive interview you can view it on the left.</p>
